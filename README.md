# Midnight Narwhal

A web 2.0 reddit client following the PRPL pattern.

##Purpose

I wanted to take a stab at using polymer with the new CLI and just a progressive web app.

##Roadmap

 - [ ] Create a custom element for interacting with the Reddit REST API.
 - [ ] Be able to browse a subreddit.
 - [ ] Be able to add the web app to your homescreen to behave like a native app.
 - [ ] Be able to access the site (and several subreddits) offline after your first visit.
 - [ ] Be able to view emoji and add them to post comments.
 - [ ] Be able to be notified of messages (possibly while not on the site via ServiceWorker).
 - [ ] Swap out the current ServiceWorker implementation for <platinum-sw> at some point.
